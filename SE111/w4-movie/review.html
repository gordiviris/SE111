            <h2>REVIEW</h2>
            <P><b>Kevin Andrade</b> <i>February 8, 2022</i><br>
            Scarface is a great movie, There is never a dull moment. Especially when Al Pacino is on screen. Tony Montana is a Cuban immigrant going from rags to richest and living the life most of us would like to have. Earning so much money and living in a mansion, driving expensive cars, and even owning a Tiger!<br><br>
            We can't forget the iconic phrase Al Pacino screams as he blows awaay the door sending men flying. "Say Hello to my little friend!". I have seen this movie multiple times and always recommend it to my friends. It never gets old despite the fact that it's from 1983.</P>
